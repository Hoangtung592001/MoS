    "StoreDescription": {
        "value": "We are a small online bookselling business specialising in rare and unusual books, generally published before 1900, with a focus on natural history, history, science and mathematics, travel and exploration, illustrated and some literature. We have recently moved to the beautiful Orkney Islands and are adding a specialist Orkney/Shetland section to our listings. We intend to open a bookstore here in the next year. We take images of all of our books to supplement the online descriptions, and are always happy to provide more on request. When you order from us, we ensure that books are properly packed to protect their condition and we always use recorded or 'signed for' postal services for additional security. Because we are based on an island which depends on ferries and flights for shipping, we can not guarantee 'next day' delivery. We will simply get your purchase to you as quickly and safely as we can.",
        "Terms of Sale": "Payment via ABEBOOKS online services, Paypal, credit card, or direct bank transfer. Personal cheques also accepted, but books will only be sent after the cheques have cleared.\n All overseas shipments are FOB, the buyer is responsible for managing and paying import duties",
        "Shipping Terms": "Shipping in the UK will be by lowest cost 'signed for' method. Shipping to the rest of the world will be by signed for and/or tracked airmail or courier. We do not use Surface Mail because our experience is that too many parcels go missing. \n We aim to ship all orders within 2 working days.\n Our shipping costs are based on an assesment of actual costs over preceding months. If your book is very heavy eg a 10 volume set, we may contact you about extra shipping. This is by exception, for example we have not had to do this at all in the last 2 years. If your book is small and light we are happy for you to enquire about shipping 'at cost'. \n All overseas shipments are FOB, the buyer is responsible for managing and paying import duties.\n We pack our books in tissue paper, layers of bubble wrap, and craft paper with parcel tape to prevent water ingress. We use boxes generally for sets of books or large items."
